I am documenting my build of an 8 Bit computer based on solderless breadboard components, from the ground up.

#Introduction
I am using the book Digital Computer Electronics by Malvino.  It starts wit the basics of computing from elementary logic and builds up from there.  I am also following along with a You Tube series by user Ben Eater that loosely follows Malvino's most basic computer the SAP-1 (Simple As Possible).  I will try to include schematics as well as photos for the writeups as I go along.
